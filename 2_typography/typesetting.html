				known for installations
				<br>
				<br>of impeccably made vessels
				in soft shades of celadon or white,
				many of them
				<br>
				<br>
				permanently displayed in places
				like the Victoria
				and Albert Museum here.
				<br>
				<br>But in the United States

				Mr. de Waal is known primarily as a writer whose
				<br>
				<br>2010
				family memoir <span>“The Hare With Amber Eyes” </span>
				became
			a surprise best seller.
				<br>
				<br>Despite countless
				rejections from
				publishers, it ended up selling more
				<br>
				<br>than 1.5 million copies, has been translated into
				26 languages and was
				recently
				<br>
				<br>optioned for a movie.</p>
